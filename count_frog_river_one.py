# A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river.
# The frog is initially located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get to the opposite bank (position X+1).
# Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.
#
# You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves.
# A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.
#
# The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.
# The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X
# (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves).
# You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.
#
# For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
#
#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 3
#   A[2] = 1
#   A[3] = 4
#   A[4] = 2
#   A[5] = 3
#   A[6] = 5
#   A[7] = 4
# In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.
#
# Write a function:
#
# class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }
#
# that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.
#
# If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return âˆ’1.
#
# For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:
#
#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 3
#   A[2] = 1
#   A[3] = 4
#   A[4] = 2
#   A[5] = 3
#   A[6] = 5
#   A[7] = 4
# the function should return 6, as explained above.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
# N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X].

# x = the width of the river
# a = the position of the leaves
# time the time that each leaf falls

# return when the path opens



A = [1,3,1,4,2,3,5,4]


def solution(X, A):
    river_positions = [False] * (X + 1) # create an array lookup with false boolean (the river size plus 1) - from index 1 not 0
    for space in range(len(A)): # iterate over ever item in the list
        pos = A[space] # access every element in the list at a time
        if not river_positions[pos]: # if there isn't a leaf then mark that position as having a leaf
            river_positions[pos] = True # set false to true when the position has a leaf
            X -= 1 # take one of the counter
            if X == 0: return space # once the counter gets to 0 then return the time
    return -1 # if the counter (x) never gets to zero then the frog cannot cross, so return -1
